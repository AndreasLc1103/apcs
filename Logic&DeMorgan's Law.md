#**Logic**
+ Logical operators are used in Boolean expressions that control the behavior of "if", "while", and "for" statements

+ && (and) => both statements must be true to make the whole condition true
+ || (or) => both statements must be false to make the whole condition false, or at least one statement must be true to make the whole condition true
+ ! (not) => switches true statements to false, and vice versa

####Relational Operators
+ > greater than
+ >= greater than or equal to
+ < less than
+ <= less than or equal to
+ == equal to
+ != not equal to
